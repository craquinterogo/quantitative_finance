    "Portfolio allocation has been for years an obsession within finance world. The reason seems easy to infer. Money, money, money ... the eternal financial mantra. This generation of money, is based some times in the idea people can outperform market behaviour, simply choosing the right assets available on it. The issue could seems easy to understand in this times but at 1952 one person change the mindset about the assets allocation, introducing an analitical approach in this matter. Markowitz was his name, and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2975974?seq=1\">Portfolio Selection</a> the materalization of his idea, in 16 pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markowitz start his paper with this quote: <i>\"The process of selecting a portfolio may be divided into two stages. The fist stage starts with observation and experience and ends with beliefs about the future performances of available securities. The second stage starts with the relevant beliefs about future performances and ends with the choise of portfolio\"</i>. With this Markowitz focused on the second one.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important idea in this paper is diversification, but it is not possible if people take into account the only idea of assessing the returns, because doing this, they ignore market's imperfections. Can you imagine, <b>having two assets with same greatest discounted value, which one is better than other?</b>. The first idea that comes to mind is, no matter. Well, this is one thing Markowitz changed. Originally, Markowitz did not include the short sales when said the relative amount invested in a security must be greates or equal to zero, or $w_i \\geq 0$. But if the only idea of take into account the returns as decision criteria, which one is the other thing we need to take into account to maximise our portfolio's return? ... today is easy infer it, the volatility ($\\sigma$), measured by standard deviation in returns and other important issue, the <b>covariance</b> between assets in the portfolio. The last one is an important idea in this model."
